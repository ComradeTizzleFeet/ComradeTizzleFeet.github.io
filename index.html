      “If you are lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
      But I wasnt so lucky or connected my first 2 years so Im here to help you
      out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a
      schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you are worrying about
      blowing your cash the whole time you wont have fun. Then check out prices,
      days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly,
      purchase your tickets and get excited!ss”

      “Always be true to your own sense of style, if you dont you wll be
      uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about
      expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
      express through their new lines. Also its important to wear shoes you wll
      be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you wll be
      on your feet all day long, so be prepared.”
